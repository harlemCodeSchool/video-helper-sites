  <h3>Web Browsers, IE:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Chrome</li>
    <li>Safari</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>Firefox</li>
    <li>Opera</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>All are designed to do one thing: </h3>
  <h3>Render HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>

  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>Hyper Text Markup Language is where you write the content of your page:
     this includes the text on the page and images and more. </p>
  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <p>Cascading Style Sheets are the layout and coloring of the page.</p>
  <h4>Javascript</h4>
  <p>Javascript is a programming language that was designed for and lives 
     in the browser. It is designed to maniuplate both HTML and CSS - 
     so that you can actually program all the aspects of the content of your
     page and the style it has. </p>
  <h3>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h3>
  <p> are all designed to work together. CSS works by targeting HTML elements
      and writing the style aspects of it. With Javascript you can 
      add, change or remove both CSS and HTMl. </p>
